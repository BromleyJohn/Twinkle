   <h1>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</h1>

   Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
   How I wonder what you are!<br>
   Up above the world so high,<br>
   Like a diamond in the sky.<br>

   <p></p>
   When the blazing sun is gone,<br>
   When he nothing shines upon,<br>
   Then you show your little light,<br>
   Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br>

   <p></p>
   Then the trav’ller in the dark,<br>
   Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br>
   He could not see which way to go,<br>
   If you did not twinkle so.<br>

   <p></p>
   In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>
   And often thro’ my curtains peep,<br>
   For you never shut your eye,<br>
   Till the sun is in the sky.<br>
